Lets you create profiles to include the selected extensions in the desired project.

Do you often have to work with different projects and different technologies?

Explanation: üí° - pending, ‚öôÔ∏è Ô∏è- in progress, ‚ùå - cancelled, ‚úÖ - done

In parentheses are those who proposed this idea:

- üí° Apply a profile to a set of selected workspaces;
- ‚úÖ Global profile ([drod3763](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-895592733), [jlongo](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-950224588));
- ‚úÖ Import selected profiles;
- üí° Multiple (combine) apply of profiles ([lakuapik](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-876195053));
- üí° Recommendations for installing missing extensions;
- üí° Convenient management of extensions for a separate project without linking to a profile or creating it;
- üí° Create a profile from the current or selected project;
- ‚úÖ Multiply delete profiles;
- ‚úÖ UI to switch profiles, a dropdown box on the bottom status bar ([dnmalenke](https://github.com/evald24/vscode-extensions-profiles/issues/1#issuecomment-1058163192)).
